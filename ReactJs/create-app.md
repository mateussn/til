# Creating a React app 

"Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React."
Says React documentation.

* Before everything, Node and npm is required!
* To create a project, just run:

``` 
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

```

* npx meaning is: Packager runner tool
* npm meaning is: Node Package Manager
