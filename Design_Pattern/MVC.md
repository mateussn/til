# What about the MVC Design Pattern?

MVC stands for Model - View - Controller and it's pretty much like a development template that helps in project organization, scalability, and so on.

Model - Has the entities methods and attribute, it has also the responsibility to push and pop information from Database 

View - It's the user interface basically

Controller - it's an intermediary between Model and view and basically controls the flow of requisitions
