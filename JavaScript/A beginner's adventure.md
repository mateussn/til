##  beginner's adventure

I am a total beginner in JavaScript, however I want to venture into this new learning.
Languages focused on WEB programming I only know and have some experience in: HTML, CSS and PHP.
I am not a programmer very used to Web and Mobile programming, however I am quite interested in these technologies.
If you are in a situation like me, embark on this adventure with me :)
