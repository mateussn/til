## introduction

So, Javascript is a dynamically typed programming language most of the times used to develop web applications, nevertheless, we can see it
everywhere. This language has 'java' in its name but has many differences in many aspects. At this right moment I know just a bit about JS, by the way, I already have seen some video tutorials on youtube. I discovered JS allows you to write scripts that
will be interpreted in clients side, that means JS can requisite things without the need to communicate with the server-side, thus
you don't need to reload the page to the modifications show up, in WEB apps it can control and modify
the site Document Object Model (DOM).

### main characteristics

for today it's only that, just a quick intro.
