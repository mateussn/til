There is kind of a tradition when someone starts to learn a new programming language, the first app must be a 
output printed message "Hello, World", the objective is to see the language running with a minimalistic code.

So, in JavaScript you can print a 'hello world' string like that:

```console.log("Hello, World!");```

where console.log is a global function that prints something in the web browser console.
