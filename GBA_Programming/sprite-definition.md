Sprites :space_invader:

First of all, what's a Sprite? 

To make it clear I already know this word, but I didn't know the correct definition of it.
Well, the WIKIPEDIA article says that in computer graphics a sprite basically is a two-dimensional bitmap
that is integrated into a larger scene.
Accordingly with TONC website, referring to games, sprite is a "small animated object that can move freely from the background‚Äù.
Also, it says that primary examples are game characters, status objects like scores and life bars.
